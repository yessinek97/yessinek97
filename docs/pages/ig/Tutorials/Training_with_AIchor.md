# Training with AIchor the IG framework


## AIchor Introduction
If you want to simply experiment with your Machine Learning code using Instadeepâ€™s best-in-class hardware and devops practices, this page is the place to start.

AIchor is Instadeep in-house ML DevOps system.

AIchor allows you to plug your Git source code repository and run ML experiments.
All experiments are triggered by a Git commit.
You can always trace back the generated files and results to the state of your code at that specific commit.
Several tools are handily available in the Ichor tool to monitor you experiment: logs, resources, tensorboard, and more to come.

If you want to know more about AIchor, you can visit the [AICHOR user manual notion page](https://www.notion.so/instadeep/User-Guide-6af905b17f734281a944d90084b9de2c)



## How to launch an experiment with AIchor

### Move Manifest file

Before launching the experiment, please make sure to move the manifest.yaml file to the root folder.
This way AIcor will be able to catch the experiment.

### Update files

#### runAIchor.sh

First put the datasets (train/test) under the datasets directory in the AIchor plateform.
Under the runAIchor.sh file update the following based on your experiment:
- test_path='path to the train csv'
- train_path='path to the test csv'

All the datasets can be accessed in the training from the PVC: '/mnt/dataset/'
Note: Do not forget to push the features.yml file in the input data

Under the runIchor.sh file you need to update the train, test, configuration file and folder name of the experiment.

the 'out' folder contains the results of the experiment, you can check it using the AIchor UI plateform.


#### Manifest file

A manifest file should be always under the root directory / to launch the experiments:
You can change the image name and it uses the Dockerfile.Aichor to build the docker image on AIchor.
The command runned will be the bash script, you can change it accordingly.

By default the number of CPUs is 50 but you are free to use more.

## Run using the CI from your terminal

To launch an experiement:
* stage the modified files
* run the commit command with EXP key

```bash
git commit -m 'EXP: test training IG framework with AIchor'
```
if you did not change anything you can run the following:

```bash
git commit -m 'EXP: test training IG framework with AIchor' --allow-empty
```

* push changes to gitlab


## Output folder

The output folder can be found on AIchor under the datasets directory/outputs/output/


## Multi train distributed

To run the multi train command in distributed mode on different worked:

* In the manifest file, you need to change the worker count paramter depanding on how many experiements you have.
-->  For exmaple, the muli train configuration command has 4 experiments (bnt, bnt_biondeep, bnt_biondeep_pmhc, bnt_pmhc)
we therefore change the number of workers to 4.

* Change the bash script command from running the default AIchor bash to running the runAIchor_multi_train.sh file.

* Make sure to change the train and test paths in the .sh file for multi training.

```bash
git commit -m 'EXP: multi train IG framework with AIchor'
```

if you did not change anything you can run the following:

```bash
git commit -m 'EXP: multi train IG framework with AIchor' --allow-empty
```


## Important note:

By default the dockerignore will ignore all by default to reduce build context as much as possible.
You can find that both

```
!runAIchor.sh
!configuration
```

were removed from the ingore to run the model with.
